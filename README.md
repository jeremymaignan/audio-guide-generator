# Audio Guides Generator
The purpose of this project is to generate audio guides from Wikipedia pages.

Imagine you're planning a weekend getaway to Paris, and you have your sights set on visiting iconic landmarks like the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and the Palace of Versailles. To enhance your experience, you can simply download audio guides for these attractions onto your phone ahead of time. 

As you explore each site, you can listen to the informative audio guide on your phone, allowing you to avoid purchasing costly guides on-site or having to read lengthy descriptions on your phone or in a guidebook.

Wikipedia is a valuable resource that offers comprehensive and engaging information about many popular destinations. For the Palace of Versaille for instance, the total duration of the audio guide would be ~40 minutes and the chapters would be:
1. Intro
2. History
3. Architecture and plan
4. Royal Apartments
5. Hall of Mirrors
6. Royal Chapel
7. Royal Opera
8. Museum of the History of France
9. Estate of Versailles
10. Modern political and ceremonial functions

## Improvements:
- Develop a mobile app to make it easier to use.
- Support any languages that have a wikipedia page available and a voice available in the pyttsx3 library.
- Suggest all the points of interest per city. We could get this information from tripadvisor.
